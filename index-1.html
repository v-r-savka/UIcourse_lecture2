      <h1>What Is The Caro-Kann Defense?</h1>
   </header>
   <!--Have any semantics-->
   <p>
      The Caro-Kann Defense is a popular chess opening for Black and enjoys the reputation of being one of the most
      solid responses to 1.e4.It has also been a favorite opening of World Champions throughout history such as
      <b>Capablanca, Botvinnik, Petrosian
         and Karpov,</b> and has seen steady growth in popularity in recent years, played by modern Super-GMs such as
      Anand,
      Adams, and Leko.
   </p>
   <p>
      The opening has been a guest at several World Chess Championship Matches throughout history, including, for
      instance, the match between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov in 1987, the match between Vladimir Kramnik and
      Peter Leko in 2004, and the match between Vishy Anand and Magnus Carlsen in 2013. The Caro-Kann belongs to the
      group of semi-open chess openings for Black and occurs after the moves 1.e4 c6 (see
      the position below).

   <h2>Caro-Kann Defense – Basics and Key Concepts </h2>
   <p>
      In contrast to the Scandinavian Defense, Black does not go for …d5 on move one. He first supports the d-pawn with
      the move …c6, so that if White captures on d5, Black can capture with the c-pawn and does not have to expose his
      queen too early.
      The Caro-Kann operates on similar principles to the Slav Defense and French Defense, in that the pawns will be
      placed primarily on 1 color (in the Caro-Kann Defense, the light-squares c6, d5, e6) and the pieces will emphasize
      control of the dark squares in the center (c5, d6, e5 etc.).</p>
